# ASCII art generator research project

Looking at novel ways to make an ascii art generator

Current thinking:

* Render a bunch of glyphs to images, and split into quarters
* Analyse different types of symmetry and aesthetics information about
  the glyphs.
* Use this to inform an algorithm for creating good looking art.

## Next steps

* Tidy up, start to build some structure
